*copy-as-rtf.txt* Plugin for copying syntax highlighted text as RTF

This plugin lets you select text or a buffer and copy it to the OS X
clipboard as RTF text.

Requirements:

  * OS X
  * The |:TOhtml| plugin, which comes with vim

Commands:

  *:CopyRTF*

    Copies the current buffer or the selected text as RTF to the
    clipboard.


                                                         *copy-as-rtf-settings*

This plugin doesn't have any settings. However, the |:TOhtml| plugin can
be configured to change how text is converted before being converted to
RTF. To set the font to match your MacVim or terminal settings, use this 
(undocumented) setting:

    let g:html_font="Your Favorite Console Font"
